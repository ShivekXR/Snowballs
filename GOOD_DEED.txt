Reselling the project files (original, parts, modified, as a binary file, compiled, etc.) is prohibited unless three conditions are met:
1. You, as the seller, like penguins.
2. You sell just the project for more than 100$ in one transaction. Yes, 100USD - one hundred United States Dollars.
3. You donate at least 10% of the transaction's price to your local or the closest animal charity or non-profit organization. Try to find the one that helps penguins. If you can't, then please donate an animal shelter.

Penguins spent half time in the water each day. Please help penguins stand on their feet on the ice for the other half. You have to keep this text file <GOOD_DEED.txt> unmodified in the root folder of the project.
